			<span class="des">Ajmer Sharif Dargah, Ajmer Dargah, Ajmer Sharif or Dargah Sharif is a sufi shrine (dargah) of the revered sufi saint, Moinuddin Chishti, located at Ajmer, Rajasthan, India. The shrine has Chisti's grave (Maqbara).<br><br>Moinuddin Chishti was a 13th-century sufi mystic saint and philosopher. Born in Sanjar (modern day Iran), or in Sijistan, he travelled across South Asia, eventually settling in Ajmer (modern day Rajasthan, India),where he died in 1236.<br><br>The initial structure of the tomb was made of wood but later covered with a canopy made of stone. The Mughal emperor Akbar built the dome around Chisti's tomb and reconstructed the sanctum sanctorum in 1579. Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Jahanara later renovated the structure. The dargah was never systematically planned and thus has multiple influences of design and materials used.An elegant covering over the dargah was constructed in 1800 by the Maharaja of Baroda.As local and national rulers came to pray here, the dargah grew in popularity and size over the years.Muhammad bin Tughluq, Sher Shah Suri, and Akbar and his descendants Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb, Dara Shikoh and Jahanara Begum were known to have visited the shrine.<br><br>The Mughal emperor Akbar first visited the dargah in 1562 after hearing about Chisti while on a hunt.He then made multiple pilgrimages to the dargah, usually before any military campaign. His most notable pilgrimage was completed on foot in 1568 from Chittor Fort to Ajmer, fulfilling a vow he had made to ensure the fall of Chittor.According to another story, Akbar made the pilgrimage from Agra to Ajmer barefooted, as a vow for a male child.[4] The large pillars called "Kose ('Mile') Minar", erected at intervals of two miles (3 km) along the entire way between Agra and Ajmer mark the places where the royal pilgrims halted every day.<br><br>In 2019, the Hindustan Zinc Limited decided to renovate the complex under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, including many plans specifically targeted at sanitation and hygiene.
