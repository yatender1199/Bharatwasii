Kochi (also colonially known as Cochin) is a city located on the southwest coast of India in the state of Kerala. It has been a major port since the 19th century and was built by the British Raj in India for its strategic and industrial importance in foreign trade. Kochi is arguably the ideal starting point for exploring the diversity and beauty of Kerala. With the best places to visit in Cochin, it has been rated among the top three tourist destinations by the World Travel & Tourism Council. Cochin and its surrounding hill station Munnar are a must visit for those touring Kerala. The backwaters of Kerala can especially be experienced through the waterways flowing across Cochin in streams and lagoons. Such places have now been converted into picnic and fishing spots, where visitors can boat through the water and stop midway on an isolated camp for some private time with nature. Fort Kochi, one of the most famous beaches has a colonial era feel and cool winds from the Arabian sea that soothes the nerves of backpackers sailing or cycling across the city. Cochin is also particularly known for its religious houses especially British era churches, and forts that have been converted into temples.

 

This lovely seaside city is flanked by the Western Ghats on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. Its proximity to the equator, the vast water body and the hills provide a moderate equatorial climate for visitors. With the best places to visit in Cochin, informally it is also referred to as the Gateway to Kerala.
