			<span class="des">Banasura Sagar Dam, which impounds the Karamanathodu tributary of the Kabini River, is part of the Indian Banasurasagar Project consisting of a dam and a canal project started in 1979.The goal of the project is to support the Kakkayam Hydro electric power project and satisfy the demand for irrigation and drinking water in a region known to have water shortages in seasonal dry periods.

In the dam's reservoir there is a set of islands that were formed when the reservoir submerged the surrounding areas.[2] The islands with the Banasura hills are in the background view.[3] It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.
The Banasura Sagar Dam is located 21 km from Kalpetta, in Wayanad District of Kerala in the Western Ghats. It is the largest earthen dam in India and the second largest in Asia[4] and a starting point for hikes into the surrounding mountains.[5] It is an important tourist attraction. Banasura Sagar Dam is at the foot of the Banasura Hill.
The Banasura Sagar Dam is named after Banasura, the son of Mahabali who as per local Hindu mythological belief was a very respected king of Kerala.
The dam has become a popular tourist destination. Many people visit the place to go trekking at the Banasura Hill & speed boating at Banasura Sagar Dam. The Banasura Hill Resort, located about 20 km from the dam was rated as Asia's largest Earthen Resort by BBC. Speed & pedal boats are available & are major hits with tourists. Speed boat ride, in particular, is an exhilarating experience & not to be missed.
