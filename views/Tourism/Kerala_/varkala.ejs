Varkala is a small city that lies within the “God’s own Country” and its high, red cliffs make it a unique place to visit. This city is situated in the northern suburbs and is a major tourism and commercial centre in the municipality of Thiruvananthapuram.

Varkala Beach is one of the major attractions of this city and attracts hundreds of people every year from all over the country. The clear blue waters with the black sand shores make the beach unique while the stunning sunset is something truly worth witnessing. The natural beauty of this beach is enhanced by the high, red rocks that have existed for millions of years due to layers of sediment, giving the whole area a surreal setting and making for some breathtaking views.

If one is looking for heritage places here, then one must visit the Janardana Swami Temple. This temple is over 2000 years old and is believed to be the shrine of Lord Vishnu. The site is so sacred that it is also referred to as the Varanasi of the South. The other places to visit are the Kappil Beach, Anjengo Fort, Sivagiri Mutt, the Varkala Tunnel, and other ancient temples that Varkala is known for.

The city of Varkala is well connected through public transport. The nearest airport is the Trivandrum International Airport which is 39 km away from the city. The ever-busy Varkala Railway Station is connected to all the major cities in India. Private buses are also available at frequent intervals from all the adjacent towns and cities, as Varkala is situated near National Highway 66.

Since Varkala city has a tropical climate, the best time to visit is during the cool and pleasant winters. The summers are generally hot and humid and the monsoon months experience heavy rainfall which might hinder your travel and sightseeing plans. The city is well-equipped with multiple guest houses and hotels for a comfortable stay. The cuisine here is mainly South Indian, but variables are also available to cater to the tourist diaspora that visits Varkala every year.
