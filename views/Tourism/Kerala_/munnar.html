			<div class="description">
			<span class="des">Munnar is a quaint town and an idyllic hill station located in the Western Ghats of Kerala. Set at an altitude of 6000 ft in the district of Idukki, Munnar used to be the summer resort of the British rulers during colonial times. It is known for its green belt of lush forests and unending expanse of tea estates and is also home to some of the endangered species of animals like Neelakurinji and Nilgiri Tahr. It is known to be one of the most sought after tourist destinations in South India due to its pristine valleys, mountains, and exotic varieties of flora and fauna. 

Munnar is a spectacular spot in Kerala, and its beauty attracts thousands of visitors every year towards it. What makes Munnar even more popular is the presence of three rivers that flow through this area, namely Mattupetti, Periavaru, and Nallathanni. Various viewpoints are segregated throughout this area, from where you can have a look at the stunning valleys, hills, and rivers. Itâ€™s pleasant hills, pristine lakes, and rocky terrains have further made it a popular trekking and camping site. 

Some of the local attractions like Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and elusive Nilgiri Tahr attract tourists from all across the world over here. Nestled between the beautiful hills of Munnar is a pristine waterfall named Atukkad Waterfall, where you can come for a romantic escapade. Photopoint is another stunning destination in Munnar filled with sparkling stream and calm woods and is an ideal spot for taking photographs. 

Trekking and camping are the most popular activities that you must try during your visit to Munnar. Apart from this, you can stay in a treehouse or visit the tea plantations for a surreal experience. Safari tour of Eravikulam National Park and Shikara ride in Kundala lake should also be the top things to do in Munnar.

The weather in Munnar remains quite pleasant throughout the year, but in summer, people especially come to this place to escape from the scorching heat in other parts of the country. During monsoon season Munnar experiences heavy rainfall that might hamper your travel plan as most of the activities are restricted during this time of the year. The best time to visit Munnar is between March to September when the weather stays very pleasant.
